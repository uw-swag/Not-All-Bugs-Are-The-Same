Notes about correlation between priority and developer experience:

Bug Level:

- most bugs are priority level 3, this could be because 3 is the default perhaps?
- level 1 priority bugs have the highest mean and median experiences
- Mean experience trends slightly down between priority 2-5, while median trends slightly upwards
	- The boxplots suggest the mean trends down because of fewer high exp outliers from 2-5


File level:

- most files are priority level 3
- mean and median priority 1 files have lowest exp
- priority 2 files have the mighest mean and median exps
- no significant correlation


Bug level vs File level:

- way more files with priority 1 & 2 compared to bugs
- While bug level shows priority 1 having highest exp, file level shows priority 1 having lowest experience by far
- to me this suggest that inexperienced devs are given menial low priority tasks that change lots of files
